Hi Grok. I am working as a Software Engineer.  I am learning machine learning using the Python3 scikit-learn module.   Recently, you helped me with the diabetes predictor app with a test suite after completing the iris flower detector app.   Together we tried several model predictors with varying levels of success.   You identified one model and we confirmed that it works the best.  I can show the code.   Stand by while I get it.  My laptop is 7 years old so we already tuned for its limitations so I don't wish to change polynomial degree.  Executing diabetes.py to build models takes about 13 minutes and executing test_diabetes.py to test models takes about 20 minutes.  I am OK with these times.  I had difficulty previously due to attempting to execute both simultaneously and swapping until calling garbage collector after each model is completed.  I am not looking for the best solution model at this time.  I am more interested in knowing what is required when using various models because I may have to support ML applications that rely on one or more of these model predictors.  This diabetes application as developed will provide examples for me to reflect on before supporting a team.  Remember, I am just getting familiar with ML applications and more importantly, I will need to know other tools and technologies and application types as well so I prefer the reference material of working examples.  After we finish this diabetes predictor app, we will work on the handwriting analysis app example.  When we are done with the examples in SciKit-Learn module, we can move on to the PyTorch module examples and then the TensorFlow examples.  For each example app, I would like to know about available models even if they are replaced with better models as we study each problem.  This way, my code will have tested code that shows how to use a particular model applied to a particular problem in case I need to switch later or support a team with a similar ML application and need to advise on alternative models to test for comparison.
