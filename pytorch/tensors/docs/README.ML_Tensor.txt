Use of CUDA
-----------
Coding can achieve performance boosts if available GPUs are used
but can work just fine without so reliant totally on CPU cores.

Use of Tensors
--------------
Data needs to be temporarily stored in arrays or matrices.
Numpy is often the library of choice but in this case Tensors perform better.

Use of Neural Networks
