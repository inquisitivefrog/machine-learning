Hi Grok.  I am working as a Software Engineer learning about machine learning.  I have developed several example applications using the scikit-learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow Python3 modules.  I have also used AWS SageMaker and AWS Braken to develop the quantum_circuit example application.  Currently, I am using SageMaker to develop the customer_churn example application.  I need some assistance.
