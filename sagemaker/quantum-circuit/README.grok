Hi Grok.  I am working as a Software Engineer.  I have developed some ML applications using examples from Python3 modules scikit-learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow.  I am now learning to use ML related tools in AWS using the AWS Free Tier.  I created a quick domain by link within AWS SageMaker.  It created a Notebook and I accessed it using JupyterLab terminal.  I used a pre-existing virtual environment to create a Quantum Circuit application with your help. I also created cleanup scripts.
